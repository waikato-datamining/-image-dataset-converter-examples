The **image-dataset-converter** library (and its dependent libraries) can be used
for converting datasets from one format into another. It has I/O support for
the following domains:

* Image classification
* Object detection
* Image segmentation

Please refer to the [Dataset formats](https://github.com/waikato-datamining/image-dataset-converter?tab=readme-ov-file#dataset-formats)
section for more details on supported formats.

But the library does not just convert datasets, you can also slot in complex filter pipelines to 
process/clean the data.

On this website you can find examples for:

* [Image classification](image_classification.md)
* [Object detection](object_detection.md)
* [Image segmentation](image_segmentation.md)
* [Filter usage](filters.md)
* [Docker usage](docker.md)

Examples for the additional libraries:

* [Image augmentation](imgaug.md)
* [Image statistics](imgstats.md)
* [Image visualizations](imgvis.md)
* [Redis predictions](redis-predictions.md)
* [Video](video.md)
